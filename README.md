### Hi 👋 wandersick here

For tech, you may know me from assistive software [AeroZoom](https://tech.wandersick.com/p/aerozoom-for-windows-7-magnifier.html) 🔎 as seen on Lifehacker, numerous popular scripts published on Microsoft Technet Gallery such as Command Prompt 'englishizer', [Englishize Cmd](https://tech.wandersick.com/p/change-non-english-command-line.html), MAC address changer, [ChMac](https://tech.wandersick.com/2019/06/chmac-windows-command-to-change-mac.html), and automated services e.g. [English Quotes](https://www.facebook.com/Quotes.English) for daily inspiration 💡.

For blogging, I write about [tech](https://tech.wandersick.com/)  ‍💻 and [personal growth](https://bookshelf.wandersick.com/) 📝 on sites like Medium (Curious/The Startup). 

See you around! 🌍 Or, if you want to [buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/wandersick) :)
